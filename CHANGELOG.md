# Changelog

All notable changes to PANICLE will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Global MLM in `PANICLE(...)` now subsets the kinship matrix correctly when
  missing/non-finite phenotype or covariate values exclude samples. Regression
  tests compare per-trait results with direct MLM using the retained samples.

### Changed
- Share trait selection, grouping, MAC preparation, and solver dispatch between
  the one-call API and pipeline, using named preparation/cache/result objects.
- Consolidate VCF/PLINK/HapMap cache handling and extract map serialization and
  result reporting into focused modules; retain interfaces and cache formats.
- Cast small int8 genotype batches directly to C-order float32, avoiding an
  intermediate int8 copy while retaining the parallel converter for large blocks.
- BLINK reuses the input matrix when its MAF filter retains all markers and uses
  pre-imputed genotype metadata for MAF calculation.
- The top-level `PANICLE(...)` API groups GLM traits with identical retained
  samples, sharing sample/MAC preparation and the genotype scan. Per-trait GLM
  runtimes apportion the shared scan time equally; the pipeline already grouped
  compatible traits. Documented the existing GLM prefetch controls.
- Growing the VCF loader's temporary matrix extends and remaps the file without
  copying and rewriting its existing prefix. Mappings are explicitly closed
  before resizing/removal, and failed remaps remain cleanable.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-19

### Changed
- **VanRaden / LOCO kinship for complete 0/1/2 dosages is now an exact Gram, and faster.** The uncentered `ZZᵀ` is accumulated from float32 batch GEMMs (exact integers at the default 5k width) into float64; centering is algebraic (`G = ZZᵀ − 1sᵀ − s1ᵀ + (μ·μ)11ᵀ`, with `s` recovered as the row-sum of `ZZᵀ`). VanRaden scaling is a scalar divide. `K` no longer depends on BLAS build, thread count, or batch width. On the maize panel this is ~15 s vs ~20–23 s for the old float32-center-then-GEMM path. This does **not** reproduce those previous matrices; association results that use kinship will change. Missing / non-{0,1,2} dosages keep the older path.
- LOCO on-disk cache format is now v2 (float64 Grams). v1 sidecars are ignored and rebuilt. The digest no longer includes `maxLine`.
- `GWASPipeline.run_analysis` logs the runtime BLAS library, version, and thread count.
- Faster LOCO MLM scan: fused `UsWUs` cross-product, strided GEMM views, reused `U'G` buffer, and `assume_no_missing` on the already-imputed path. Single-trait `PANICLE_MLM_LOCO` now routes through the chromosome-major multi-trait kernel so a trait analysed alone and in a group share the same numbers (float32 rounding only vs the previous single-trait path).

### Added
- Parallel `int8→float32` convert for large C-contiguous blocks (bit-identical to `astype`; used on whole-chromosome scans, not 5k kinship batches).
- Prepare-cache key includes `max_dosage` as well as `min_mac`.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Packaged GWAS CLI:** `panicle-gwas` console script and `python -m panicle` after `pip install panicle`. Implementation lives in `panicle.cli.gwas`; `scripts/run_GWAS.py` is a thin compatibility wrapper.
- `--version` on the GWAS CLI.
- `mlm_mode` / `--mlm-mode` (`loco` default, or `global`) selects LOCO vs full-kinship MLM. Global kinship is always computed from genotypes when needed; external kinship inputs are not accepted on the high-level API or CLI.
- PR/push CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs pytest across Python 3.9–3.13.

### Fixed
- Genotype binary caches (VCF/PLINK/HapMap/numeric) now fingerprint QC filter settings in a `*.panicle.v2.filters.json` sidecar. Changing `min_maf`, `max_missing`, `drop_monomorphic`, `include_indels`, or `split_multiallelic` rebuilds the cache instead of silently reusing a prior marker set. Legacy caches without a sidecar are rebuilt once.
- `GWASPipeline` FarmCPU defaults no longer force `p_threshold=alpha` (0.05). Unset thresholds now use the library rMVP-style early-stop (`0.01/n_tests`) and uncorrected QTN threshold of 0.01.
- `compute_mac_keep_indices` excludes missing genotype sentinels (`-9`) and non-finite values from allele counts so unimputed matrices are not mis-filtered.
- `PANICLE()` no longer eagerly computes an unused VanRaden kinship matrix when FarmCPU is requested (FarmCPU does not consume kinship).
- GLM residual-df < 50 now uses Student-t p-values (with a one-time console warning) instead of a normal approximation that understates p-values on small cohorts.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- Faster LRT-based MLM: the per-marker likelihood-ratio refinement now runs through a dedicated Numba kernel (verified to reproduce the prior implementation to ~1e-15). CPU-budget parallelism is now affinity/cgroup-aware via `available_cpu_count()`, and small jobs are guarded against thread oversubscription.
- Optimized builtin VCF parsing path (bulk/numba fast paths) for faster first-load; output encoding is unchanged.
- `load_genotype_vcf(backend='auto')` uses the builtin text parser for `.vcf`/`.vcf.gz` and reserves cyvcf2 for `.bcf` (reverses the 0.3.3 note that `auto` preferred cyvcf2 for VCF text). Outputs are identical across paths.
- Removed the LOCO-kinship per-chromosome threading in favor of the sequential batched path (performance only; results unchanged).
- Tutorial notebooks moved from `docs/` to `examples/`; README opener reworked.

### Fixed
- A supplied `--map` whose marker IDs differ from the genotype's but match in count and order is now treated as a positional override (logged as a warning) instead of being rejected; a length mismatch still raises.
- Near-singular (very low-MAF) designs in the LRT solver now route to the exact fallback via a relative pivot tolerance, instead of returning large finite (garbage) standard errors.
- `PANICLE_MLM_LOCO_MULTI` now expands `cpu=0` via the affinity-aware `available_cpu_count()`, matching the other LOCO paths and avoiding oversubscription on cgroup/SLURM-limited nodes.
- Excluded sample IDs are stringified before logging, so numeric IDs no longer raise a `TypeError` on the exclusion path.
- Hardened marker-map alignment checks and guarded lazy genotype-subset storage access against reading the unsubsetted parent array.

### Internal
- `panicle.utils.effective_tests` now reports the pre-prune block size for `n_snps` consistently across the shortcut and eigendecomposition paths (`Me`/total counts were already correct).

## [0.3.4] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Manhattan plot chromosome misassignment when MAC filter (or any other path that produces NaN-padded p-values) was active in 0.3.3.** `PANICLE_Report` pre-filtered NaN p-values before calling `create_manhattan_plot`, then `create_manhattan_plot` aligned the surviving p-values against `map_df['CHROM'].values[:len(pvalues)]` — slicing the *first N* markers of the map rather than the markers that actually survived filtering. This silently shifted peaks onto neighboring chromosomes (e.g., a real chr8 peak rendering on chr7) and could drop the last chromosome entirely from the plot. The merged `GWAS_<trait>_all_results.csv` was unaffected (its assignment used the full-length padded results against the full map). Per-method PNG Manhattan plots are now correctly aligned. `create_manhattan_plot` and `create_multi_panel_manhattan` now require `len(map_data) == len(pvalues)` and apply the finite-pvalue mask jointly to both arrays.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-04-21

### Added
- Per-trait minor allele count (MAC) filter applied *after* sample subsetting, guarding against spurious p-values driven by singleton/very-rare variants when missing phenotypes or covariates reduce the cohort. Exposed as `min_mac=` on `GWASPipeline.run_analysis()` and `PANICLE()` (default 10 — twice the common PLINK `--mac 5` convention, appropriate for inbred cohorts where effective sample size per allele is roughly half) and as `--min-mac` on the CLI. Set to 0 to disable.
- `GenotypeMatrix.subset_markers()` and `GenotypeMap.subset_markers()` helpers.
- Shared `compute_mac_keep_indices()` and `pad_association_results()` utilities in `panicle.utils.stats`.
- Per-trait Bonferroni denominator now uses the post-MAC marker count so the significance threshold reflects the number of tests actually performed.
- `threads=` parameter on `load_genotype_vcf()` and matching `--threads` CLI flag for tuning cyvcf2/htslib decompression workers (0 = all detected CPUs, default = min(4, cpu_count)).

### Changed
- Default behavior: `min_mac=10` is now applied by default in the high-level GWAS APIs. Pass `min_mac=0` to restore pre-0.3.3 behavior.
- VCF first-load ingestion now writes the dynamic int8 matrix in marker-major order so each appended marker is a contiguous write, then transposes once on finalize. Speeds up VCF first-load without affecting the cached output layout.
- `load_genotype_vcf(backend='auto')` now prefers cyvcf2 when installed (previously defaulted to the builtin text parser for VCF/VCF.GZ).

## [0.3.2] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- High-level `PANICLE()` support for internal PCA via `n_pcs`, with computed PCs appended after any external covariates.
- Regression coverage for `PANICLE()` MLM runs with NA-padded phenotypes and trait-specific LOCO sample subsetting.

### Fixed
- Guarded LOCO MLM against reusing kinship matrices built on the wrong sample subset after phenotype filtering.
- Updated user-facing documentation so the high-level API consistently documents internal PCA support.
